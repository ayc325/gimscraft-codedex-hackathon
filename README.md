## Notes

Describe an challenges encountered while doing the hackathon project.

Some challenges I faced was with CSS and overflow X scrolling in images. I was able to fix this by setting a max-width.

Describe some features you would include further if you had more time.

I would like to incorporate more dynamic pages like making it mobile friendly using media queries if I had more time.
